# Avataar-Object-Segmentation
This project showcases deep learning techniques for object manipulation, emphasizing object shifting and inpainting. Using the Segment Anything Model (SAM) for segmentation and the Stable Diffusion model for inpainting, it allows users to shift objects within an image and seamlessly fill the void with background information.
